The Actors example for the [Seductions of Scala](https://github.com/deanwampler/Presentations/tree/master/SeductionsOfScala) presentation and tutorial. This code can be found in the [tutorial-exercises/drawing-actors](https://github.com/deanwampler/Presentations/tree/master/SeductionsOfScala/tutorial-exercises/drawing-actors) subdirectory.

This is a simple example using the [Akka Framework](http://akka.io) v2.1.X for Scala and Java, with Scala v2.10.X.

The example is built and run using the [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/), the de facto standard build tool for Scala projects. You'll need to install the `sbt` command to build this project. See [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) for installers. 

## Instructions

Change to the root directory for the actors example `SeductionsOfScala/tutorial-examples/drawing-actors`. 

Using a `bash` shell or Windows command window, run `sbt`, as instructed by the `sbt` installation process.

At the `sbt` prompt (`>`), run the following commands. (The #... are comments and shouldn't be typed).

    update   # Pull down the other dependencies
    compile  # Compile the code.
    test     # Run the simple ScalaTest unit tests. (Also runs compile)
    run      # Run the actor example.
    quit     # Exit sbt.

The first time start `sbt` and run `update1`, it may take a while to download the dependencies (including the rest of the `sbt` code itself!). 

The fairly verbose output of the commands should end with the following for a successful run:

    ...
    [info] Running shapes.ShapesDrawingDriver
    -> drawing: Circle(Point(0.0,0.0),1.0)
    -> drawing: Rectangle(Point(0.0,0.0),2.0,5.0)
    <- Shape drawn.
    -> Error: 3.14159
    <- Shape drawn.
    -> exiting...
    <- Unknown message: 3.14159
    <- cleaning up...
    [success] Total time: 6 s, completed Apr 21, 2013 5:35:23 PM

The messages starting with `->` are written by the **drawing** actor that receives drawing commands from the **driver** actor. The messages starting with `<-` are written by the driver actor. They are the replies received from the drawing actor.

Note that the interleaving of `<-` and `->` messages will be *arbitrary*, **but**, the `->` messages will *always* be in the same order and the `<-` messages will *always* be in the same order, because the drawing actor processes the messages it receives in order, one at a time.

The drawing actor is in `src/main/scala/ShapesDrawingActor.scala`, while the driver actor is in `src/main/scala/ShapesDrawingDriver.scala`.

## Extensions

This is just the tip of the iceberg. The example doesn't demonstrate the user of actor supervisor hierarchies, remote actors, Akka's support for *dataflow* programming or *finite-state machines*, etc. A good, more complete *Kata* for Akka actors is [here](https://github.com/henrikengstrom/akka-meetup-sthlm).

For now, there are a few extensions you can implement with this example:

* Add a `Triangle` class. Actually, `shapes.scala` already defines one. Add messages that send triangles. What other code changes, if any are required?
* Replace the ad-hoc strings used as messages with typed messages. This is a great use for case classes. Which ones can actually be case objects, rather than classes?
* Instead of firing all the draw messages at once, send them synchronously, one at a time when the acknowledgement for the last sent message is received. What are the pros and cons of these two strategies? 
* Send other messages, e.g., a "clear screen" message, a "redraw" message, etc.
* Replace the `println` statements with a Logging trait that saves the messages somehow (e.g., a `StringBuffer` and list of messages, etc.). Then write a `ScalaTest` for the actors. Hint: the synchronous change mentioned above will help! (Akka now comes with modules to support testing. In the general case, testing a distributed, non-deterministic application, is hard!)
* Add logic to handle the case that the Drawing actor hasn't been sent to the Driver yet, e.g., cue up waiting messages, then send them when the Drawing actor is specified.
* Start a second drawing actor and round-robin messages to the pair.
* Advanced: Look at the Akka documentation for supervising actors. Send a never-ending stream of shapes, but periodically kill the drawing actor and implement the logic to have it restarted by the supervisor automatically.
